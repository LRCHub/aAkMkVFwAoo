[00:06.03] I don't want a lot for Christmas
[00:12.32] There is just one thing I need
[00:17.04] I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
[00:24.30] I just want you for my own
[00:28.40] More than you could ever know
[00:33.01] Make my wish come true
[00:38.72] All I want for Christmas is you
[00:54.22] 
[00:55.13] Yeah
[00:57.13] 
[00:57.29] I don't want a lot for Christmas
[01:00.28] There is just one thing I need (and I)
[01:04.17] Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
[01:10.05] I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
[01:16.60] Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
[01:46.10] 
[01:22.63] I just want you for my own
[01:25.84] More than you could ever know
[01:29.16] Make my wish come true
[01:32.19] All I want for Christmas is you
[01:38.78] You, baby
[01:43.28] 
[01:41.60] Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
[01:45.19] I won't even wish for snow (and I)
[01:48.96] I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
[01:54.74] I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
[02:01.39] I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
[02:30.39] 
[02:07.49] 'Cause I just want you here tonight
[02:10.73] Holding on to me so tight
[02:13.70] What more can I do?
[02:16.67] Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
[02:23.29] You, baby
[02:27.79] 
[02:26.17] Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
[02:33.29] And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
[02:39.54] And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
[02:42.80] I hear those sleigh bells ringing
[02:45.71] Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
[02:48.89] Won't you please bring my baby to me?
[03:07.39] 
[02:51.91] Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
[02:55.02] This is all I'm asking for
[02:58.70] I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
[03:26.20] 
[03:04.73] Oh, I just want you for my own
[03:07.95] More than you could ever know
[03:11.50] Make my wish come true
[03:14.22] Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
[03:24.52] You, baby
[03:29.02] 
[03:27.05] All I want for Christmas is you, baby
[03:33.92] All I want for Christmas is you, baby
[03:39.86] All I want for Christmas is you, baby
[03:46.30] All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
[03:52.89] All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
